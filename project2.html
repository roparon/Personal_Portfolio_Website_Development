            <h1>Abnas High School Management Platform</h1>
            <img src="/abnas.jpg" alt="Abnas High School Management Platform Image" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <p>The Abnas High School Management Platform is an integrated system designed to help school administrators, teachers, and students efficiently manage school activities. From student enrollment and grading to timetables and attendance, this platform streamlines all aspects of school operations, making it easier for everyone involved.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React.js)</li>
                <li>Backend: PHP, Laravel</li>
                <li>Database: MySQL</li>
                <li>Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</li>
                <li>Deployment: Apache, Docker</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student Enrollment:</strong> Admins can easily manage student records, track enrollments, and update details like grades and attendance.</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher Assignments:</strong> Teachers can be assigned to classes, and their schedules can be tracked efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade Management:</strong> The platform allows teachers to grade students and generate reports on student performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Timetable Generation:</strong> Automatically generates class timetables and manages teacher schedules.</li>
                <li><strong>Attendance Monitoring:</strong> Track student attendance and generate reports based on absence data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions:</h2>
            <p>One of the major challenges was creating a seamless interface that works for both administrators and teachers. The solution was to implement user roles and permissions, allowing admins to have access to more features, while keeping the interface simple for teachers and students.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was integrating real-time data updates, particularly for attendance tracking. To solve this, we implemented WebSocket technology to enable real-time updates, ensuring that attendance data is updated instantly as teachers mark attendance.</p>

            <h2>Result:</h2>
            <p>The Abnas High School Management Platform has significantly improved administrative efficiency, allowing the school to handle student information, grades, timetables, and attendance in one central system. It has been praised for its user-friendly interface and the ease with which it handles the various aspects of school management.</p>
